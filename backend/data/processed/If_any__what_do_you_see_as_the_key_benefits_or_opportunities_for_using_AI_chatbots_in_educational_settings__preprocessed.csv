"Sometimes I will have some idea or concept that's ""on the tip of my tounge"". For example, I might use a dictionary or thesaurus or search engine to find the name of a concept I partially remember or to find related concepts. So chatbots serve a similar role. Another example is semanticially searching programming documentation (we used it for learning MCNP). But otherwise chatbots generally fail at providing reliably true results, and are pretty useless for courses in my degree path. I also find that LLMs produce mediocre results for creative writing but this may be prompt or model-specific.",sometimes i will have some idea or concept thats on the tip of my tounge for example i might use a dictionary or thesaurus or search engine to find the name of a concept i partially remember or to find related concept so chatbots serve a similar role another example is semanticially searching programming documentation we used it for learning mcnp but otherwise chatbots generally fail at providing reliably true result and are pretty useless for course in my degree path i also find that llm produce mediocre result for creative writing but this may be prompt or modelspecific
